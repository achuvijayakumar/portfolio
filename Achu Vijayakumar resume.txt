## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### Software Engineer – LPE Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd.

*Sep 2025 – Present*

**– Distributed Backend Trading Platform**

* Engineered an event-driven backend using Redis as the central message bus, decoupling the UI from parallel processing agents.
* Orchestrated task management via impl.py, coordinating agent polling (orderbook, balance, positions) and triggering downstream Redis-based automation.
* Established a custom Order Management System (OMS) to coordinate multi-leg trades using atomic Redis HDEL locking for concurrency control.
* Designed and enforced an OI crossover automation engine using Net Put/Call tracking, spot-based triggers, and hysteresis filters.
* Executed a real-time payoff simulator with vectorized Black-Scholes pricing and live Greeks rendered via Plotly inside Streamlit.
* Initiated watcher modules (e.g., LevelCEWatcher) to monitor breakout levels and push actionable intents.
* Applied structured logging, self-healing token auth, and Telegram notifications for system visibility and reliability.
* Incorporated MotherDuck to warehouse PnL history, utilizing SQL-based FIFO logic via DuckDB window functions.
* Developed a robust PDF ingestion and ETL routine to normalize trade data using pdfplumber and regex-based table parsing.
* Applied cache-warming strategies to preload 50k+ instrument entries into Redis hashes, enabling O(1) lookups.

**Streamlit UI & Redis-Driven Workflow Tools**
*Constructed multi-tab Streamlit dashboards with real-time feedback and Redis-bound actions (e.g., PLACE_ORDER, FETCH_BALANCE).
*Enhanced form components using session state and dynamic field generation for expiry, strike, option type, and lot.

**File Automation, CLI Scripts** 
*Generated UID-specific CSV pipelines to persist live trade/book data across users.
*Built CLI tools (test_ui.py, cli_fetch.py) to validate Redis calls and API responses.
*Enforced automation for data refresh, log cleanup, and Redis expiry management using cron and bash.

**Nifty Analytics Toolkit**
*Created automation flows for data extraction and transformation from internal trading records.
*Executed expiry selection and instrument resolution using dropdown-driven UI components backed by local text-based lookup.
*Generated LTP/strike queries for real-time option discovery.
